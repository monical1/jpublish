# JPublish fundamentals #

JPublish web sites consist of several elements which are separated by the roles of the parties who typically work on those elements. The following table lists each of the different JPublish elements along with the developer role typically associated with that element:

|Element|	Role|
|:------|:----|
|Templates|	Designers|
|Content|	Authors|
|Actions|	Programmers|
|Pages  |	Integrators|
|tatic Resources|	No Role|


Simply put, JPublish lets designers work on template design, authors create content, programmers develop actions, and integrators can connect all of the pieces into pages. The clear separation of roles provided by JPublish makes team development much easier and can help speed development and clarify projects, even with only one developer. All of these elements are assembled into complete pages by the JPublish engine at request-time.
